## üîç Research Gaps

The most critical research gap identified in this batch of papers is the need for further investigation into the clinical implications of machine learning models in medical decision-making. While the papers demonstrate the potential of machine learning to improve disease diagnosis and treatment outcomes, there is a lack of understanding about how these models can be safely and effectively integrated into clinical practice. This gap is particularly important to address, as the widespread adoption of machine learning in healthcare requires a deep understanding of its clinical implications and potential biases.

To address this gap, future research should focus on developing and validating machine learning models that are transparent, interpretable, and clinically relevant. This may involve conducting prospective studies to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in real-world clinical settings, as well as developing and testing strategies for mitigating potential biases and errors. Additionally, research should prioritize the development of machine learning models that are designed to work in conjunction with human clinicians, rather than replacing them. By addressing this gap, researchers can help ensure that machine learning is used in a way that benefits patients and improves healthcare outcomes.
